# Task 4: Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data

As part of my Data Science Internship with Prodigy InfoTech, this project analyzes and visualizes sentiment patterns from social media (Twitter) data.

## Dataset
- **File:** twitter_training.csv
- **Fields:** ID, Topic, Sentiment (Positive/Negative/Neutral), Tweet

## Project Workflow
1. Data loaded & inspected
2. Duplicates removed for clean analysis
3. Focused on sentiment classes: Positive, Negative, Neutral
4. Visualized sentiment distribution and breakdown by topic
5. Printed example tweets for each sentiment

## Key Insights
- Certain topics (e.g., "Borderlands") have strong positive and negative community feedback.
- Negative tweets often cite specific grievances, while positives highlight excitement.
- Neutral tweets are most often factual news or updates.

## Visuals
- Sentiment distribution bar plot
- Sentiment breakdown by top topics
